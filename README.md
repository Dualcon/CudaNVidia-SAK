CUDA-SAK
========

CUDA-SAK (CUDA Swiss Army Knife) it's a Cuda nvidia tool programed in C to help programmers during some boring tasks like coding predefined blocks of code. In this project we added 14 familiar Cuda functions and a last one, to select which line the chosen function should be injected. Feel free to use it and leave some sugestions.
